### Objectives

- Create the web page of the book bank so the volunteers of the program can make the loans of materials such as gowns, glasses and calculators.

- With my partner we wanted to learn to integrate technologies like Node js, React, Express and MongoDB in an application that was useful for the volunteer that we are both advancing with a support network for students at the university.


### How do you run?

- If you try to run the project locally, you need to download the "my-app" file located in this repository. Remember it is necessary to have locally installed Node js, npm and Mongo DB. After verifying the above, you must open the operating system console and through this you must navigate to reach the folder where the file mentioned above was downloaded. This is up on the "src" folder that contains "my-app". There you must execute the command "npm index.js", this in the case of windows. Finally, you must add the address "http: // localhost: 7777" in the browser and you can see the application displayed.

- But you can trie visit the web page with the following URL: . And remember, in the browser it is necessary to enable a script, which by default both mozilla and chrome block for security.
